# Example: createReactApp

This example doesn't have much in it besides this readme! all the effort comes from you!

## Pre-requisites

Have Node.js and npm (version 5.2 or greater) installed.

You could use:
- https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- https://nodejs.org/en/

## Steps

Essentially follow the guide on React's own site:
- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

1. Ensure you are in the `./introTopics/examples/createReactApp` directory
2. run `npx create-react-app super-mega-app --template typescript`
3. Wait for the download/automatic setup to run!
4. Change directory into your app (`cd super-mega-app)
5. run `yarn start` 
6. A browser _should_ automatically open!
   1. If it doesn't though, look at the outputs of `yarn start` to see where the app is running
   2. For example:   `Local:            http://localhost:3000`
   3. Navigate in your browser to the address that was output: http://localhost:3000
